# Summer School 2016

Summer School is a course in algorithms and data structures. The course is run via the [WellingtonRuby Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/WellingtonRuby) and features weekly assignments and review sessions.

On this repo, assignments live in separate sub-folders. Files are first commited as provided (`Add Assignment XX`), then with my solution (`Add Assignment XX Solution`) and finally the reviewed version (`Add Assgiment XX Correction`).
